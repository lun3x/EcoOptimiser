A web app built in 24 hours, for the CSS Boeing Hackathon, with the aim of increasing public awareness and support for renewable energy within the UK.

Many people don't realise just how much potential there is in the UK for renewable energy, but we have some of the most powerful tides and strongest winds both in Europe and the world.

We've hightlighted the most economically viable areas in the UK for each renewable resource based off data from serveral sources, including the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis, the National River Flow Archive, and RenSMART.
